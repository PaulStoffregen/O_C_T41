## Rev 3 issues:

C93 polarity is not indicated on silkscreen

Mounting holes for display may be slightly off

Mounting holes for display should enlarge slightly to allow M2 screws

**3 beta testers had Teensy I/O pins damaged**, mostly encoders and pushbuttons.  If you build Rev 3, **USE A SOCKET** between Teensy and the CPU board.

Audio input clipping on 1 channel distorts other channel input

Control board should allow more clearance for external trigger headers / wires
